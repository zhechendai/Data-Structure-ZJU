# Data-Structure-ZJU

Here is my Data Structure course Practical files and Homework files.

I'm studying Data Structure by following the [ZJU MOOC](https://www.icourse163.org/learn/ZJU-93001?tid=1459700443#/learn/content) given by Chen Yue and He Qinming. Studying notes is on my [NotesStack](https://notes.daizhechen.com).
